# Stroke Prediction Model - README

This repository contains code for predicting strokes using the Stroke Prediction dataset. It consists of a Jupyter Notebook file and the required dataset files. The code uses the ElasticNet algorithm for prediction.

## Dataset
- `healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv`: The main dataset containing information about individuals, including demographic, health, and lifestyle factors.
- `stroke-train.csv`: Additional training dataset for model development.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Running the Code
1. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your Python environment.
2. Make sure the dataset files (`healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv` and `stroke-train.csv`) are in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook file.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Untitled10-2.ipynb`.
4. Run each cell sequentially to execute the code.
5. The final predictions will be saved in a file named `stroke-best-submission_df.csv`.

## Code Overview
1. Loading and Preprocessing the Data:
   - Load the dataset files using pandas' `read_csv` function.
   - Concatenate the two datasets into a single dataframe.
   - Handle missing values and drop unnecessary columns.

2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:
   - Perform one-hot encoding on categorical variables.
   - Split the data into input features (`x`) and target variable (`y`).

3. Model Training:
   - Fit an ElasticNetCV model using cross-validation.

4. Predictions on Test Data:
   - Load the test dataset (`stroke-test.csv`).
   - Preprocess the test data similar to the training data.
   - Make predictions using the trained model.

5. Creating the Submission File:
   - Prepare the submission file by including only the required columns.
   - Save the submission file as `stroke-best-submission_df.csv`.

Please note that this README provides a brief overview of the code and its usage. For more details, refer to the Jupyter Notebook file.
